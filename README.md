This website consists of basic code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I'm planning on redesigning the website to act as a blogpost for me to share stories and allow users to react to (basic commenting and like feature). Right now the code acts as a basic webpage with just my information. Feel free to copy my code and manipulate it however you please. All that I ask is that you remove my personal information from the webpage before hosting it.
