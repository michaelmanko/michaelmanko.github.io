      <p class="left-aligned-text">Having been a prisoner of war in Vietnam for eight years, James Stockdale drew upon Stoicism, an ancient Greek philosophy, to help him through his struggles. 
      This is a two-part series which I strongly recommend. The text references 'Epictetus' Discourses', with many lessons drawn from 'The Enchiridion.' I find it really interesting that a POW can apply philosophies from over 2000 years ago
      to help him in his struggles. Having read a lot about Greek and Roman history, I think this is a great modern piece of applied Greek/Roman philosophy. The United States is based on Greece and Rome, after all.</p> <!-- Body text -->


      <h2 class="left-aligned-text">Cato the Younger: By Plutarch</h2> <!-- Header for the article name -->
      <p class="left-aligned-text"><a href="https://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/cato_you.html">https://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/cato_you.html</a></p> <!-- Hyperlink -->
      <p class="left-aligned-text">This article is a summary of Cato the Younger, a Roman Senator who lived and died for the Roman Republic. Having been a prominent objector to Julius Caesar, he fought to protect the Roman Republic under the threat of tyranny. 
        Although his story doesn't end well (the Republic is destroyed), his story is a testament to the honesty and bravery of those committed to the wellbeing of Rome. Cato the Younger was admired by many of our country's founders (such as George Washington),
      which I find interesting. </p> <!-- Body text -->
